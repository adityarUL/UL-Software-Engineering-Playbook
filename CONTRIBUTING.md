## Step-by-Step Contribution Process

1. **Start in Azure DevOps (ADO)**
   - Find your assigned Epic → Feature → User Story → Task.
   - Each work item should result in a `.md` file contribution.

2. **Use a Template**
   - Use the markdown templates in the `/templates/` folder:
     - [Feature](templates/feature-contribution-template.md)
     - [User Story](templates/user-story-contribution-template.md)
     - [Task](templates/task-contribution-template.md)

3. **Create a Branch**
   - Use a clear naming format:  
     `feature/<epic-topic>` or `us/<user-story-topic>`  
     _Example:_ `feature/code-review-standards`

4. **Add Your `.md` File**
   - Place the file inside the correct Epic folder in `/engineering-playbook/`
   - Example: `/engineering-playbook/01-team-agreements/code-review-checklist.md`

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Link your PR to the corresponding ADO work item
   - Use the provided PR template if available
   - Assign a reviewer from the V-Team

6. **V-Team Review**
   - The assigned reviewer will check for clarity, completeness, structure, and traceability.
   - Revisions may be requested before approval and merge.

7. **Link PR Back to ADO**
   - After merging, paste the PR link in the ADO work item
   - Mark it as Done or Ready for Sign-off

## Contribution Tips

- Keep documentation concise and relevant
- Use bullet points, headings, and code blocks to organize content
- Link to real examples when possible
- Avoid overusing acronyms or organization-specific jargon
- Reference the [Sample Contribution](engineering-playbook/01-team-agreements/) to see what "good" looks like
