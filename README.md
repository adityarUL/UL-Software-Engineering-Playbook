# UL Software Engineering Playbook

Welcome! This repository contains the official UL Engineering Playbook. It captures our agreed ways of working, technical standards, and engineering best practices.

This playbook is built by contributions from the UL Architecture and Engineering teams. It is structured in a way that ensures every contribution is:
- Easy to write using markdown templates
- Reviewed by the V-Team
- Traceable to Azure DevOps (ADO) work items

## How to Contribute

3. Add your `.md` file inside the correct Epic folder under `/engineering-playbook`
4. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to `main`, link it to the ADO work item

6. Once merged, paste the PR link back in the ADO work item and mark it complete
