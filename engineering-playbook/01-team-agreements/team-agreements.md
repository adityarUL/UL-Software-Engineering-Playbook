# Team Agreements

## Why It Matters
Team Agreements are the **foundation of psychological safety and team alignment**. They define how team members collaborate, communicate, resolve conflict, and hold each other accountable. Clear expectations reduce friction, build trust, and create space for high performance — especially in remote or cross-functional teams.

## Industry Best Practices

- Use a written **Team Charter** with team-defined norms  
- Clearly define **Definition of Ready (DoR)** and **Definition of Done (DoD)**  
- Establish **cadence for retrospectives, planning, and standups**  
- Encourage use of **health checks** and **feedback surveys**  
- Document async expectations and working hours for distributed teams  
- Embed agreements in onboarding and team rituals

## Best Practices Observed (UL Teams)

- Consistent agile ceremonies (standups, retros, sprint planning)
- Clear async collaboration norms and timezone-friendly rituals for remote teams
- Visible delivery rhythm and embedded team cadences
- Kickoff materials that include team member responsibilities
- Backlog ownership clarified in sprint-level delivery
- Roles between developers and QA aligned via retrospectives

---

## Gaps Identified (vs. Microsoft Playbook)

- No team-wide **working agreement templates**
- **Definition of Ready / Done** is inconsistently applied or missing  
- Lack of structured **team health surveys** or feedback loops  
- Onboarding checklists do not cover **"how we work"**  
- Async norms (e.g., turnaround SLAs) not defined across all teams  

---

## UL Playbook Guidance

### Working Agreements

- Schedule a team kickoff workshop to define **working norms**:
  - Tools (Teams, Email, Wiki, etc.)
  - Working hours (core hours, async zones)
  - Decision logging (e.g., lightweight Decision Logs)
  - Conflict resolution expectations

- Store in project wiki or SharePoint under "Team Charter"

---

### Definition of Ready (DoR) and Done (DoD)

- **DoR includes**:
  - Groomed
  - Estimated
  - Dependencies resolved
  - Clear acceptance criteria  
- **DoD includes**:
  - Code complete
  - Peer reviewed
  - Tests pass
  - Documentation updated
  - Merged to main

Adopt **DoR/DoD** as gates during sprint planning and demo review.

---

### Team Health Checks

- Run a **5-question pulse survey** monthly
- Discuss in retros and track themes
- Assign actions with owners and link to backlog

---

### Clarify Roles and Responsibilities

- Publish RACI or ownership doc per team
- Include in onboarding wiki
- Revisit quarterly or during role changes

## Summary

This topic defines the foundational expectations for how UL engineering teams operate. When implemented well, it improves:

- Sprint reliability  
- Developer experience  
- Psychological safety  
- Onboarding success  
- Feedback culture

**This section is required reading for all new teams and should be included in onboarding documentation.**
