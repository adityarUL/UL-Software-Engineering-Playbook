- Set up load test thresholds to simulate scale
- Review scaling requirements with infrastructure team

## User Story: Ensure components are loosely coupled and easily extensible

### Tasks:
- Define and publish public interfaces in each repo
- Add extensibility checklist to design docs
- Use feature flags for early code paths
- Review extensibility in design review
